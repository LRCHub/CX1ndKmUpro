Wish that I had known all along: "Nothing for the singer, all for the song." From Gloria, in 1985 when Spanish screams and broken water flooded the hallway.
If I had read before my mind was brick, I'd have a good head on my neck.
Instead, in a hospital bed, I count gold, as the knots in our spines render us equal.
You will leave me.
When will you leave me?
