First time I saw her she was sweet sixteen
Pretty like a butterfly & proud like a queen
Second time around she was all grown up
Perky like a princess, peppy like a pup
Third time I saw her she was working in a bar
She's a rock 'n' roll chick & she's looking like a star
Next thing I knew she was naked in my bed
Best morning glory that I've ever had

Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
Ma-a Gloria
Glorious euphoria

Gloria
She is my priestess
Gloria
Gonna be my mistress
Gloria
Like Capypso to Odysseus
Ma-a Gloria
Glorious euphoria

Uh-uh-uh
She is my priestess
Uh-uh-uh
With God as my witness
Uh-uh-uh
Like Capypso to Odysseus
Ma-a Gloria
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
